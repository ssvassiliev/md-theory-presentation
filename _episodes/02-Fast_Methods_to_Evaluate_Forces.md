## Challenges in calculation of non bonded interactions. 

- The number of non-bonded interactions increases as the square of the number of atoms. 
- The most computationally demanding part of a molecular dynamics simulation is the calculation of the non-bonded interactions.
- Simulation can be significantly accelerated by limiting the number of evaluated non bonded interactions.  
- Exclude pairs of atoms separated by long distance.
- Maintain a list of all particles within a predefined cutoff distance of each other.

## Neighbour Searching Methods
 - Divide simulation system into grid cells - cell lists. 
 - Compile a list of neighbors for each particle searching all pairs - Verlet lists.

### Cell Lists
- Divide the simulation domain into cells with edge length greater or equal to the cutoff distance. 
- Interaction potential of a particle is the sum of the pairwise interactions with all other particles in the same cell and all neighboring cells.

### Verlet Lists
- Verlet list stores all particles within the cutoff distance plus some extra buffer distance.
- All pairwise distances must be evaluated.
- List is valid until any particle has moved more than half of the buffer distance.

- Efficient computation of pairwise interactions.
- Relatively large memory requirement.
- In practice, almost all simulations use a combination of spatial decomposition and Verlet lists.

### Problems with Truncation of Lennard-Jones Interactions. How to Avoid Them?

- LJ potential is always truncated at the cutoff distance.
- Truncation introduces a discontinuity in the potential energy.
- A sharp change in potential may result in nearly infinite forces. 

#### Approaches to minimize the impact of the truncation.

### How to Choose the Appropriate Cutoff Distance?
- A common practice is to truncate at 2.5 $$\sigma$$.
- At this distance, the LJ potential is about 1/60 of the well depth $$\epsilon$$. 
- The choice of the cutoff distance depends on the force field and atom types.

 For example for the O, N, C, S, and P atoms in the AMBER99 force field the values of $$\sigma$$ are in the range 1.7-2.1,  while for the Cs ions  $$\sigma=3.4$$. Thus the minimum acceptable cutoff, in this case, is 8.5.

- Increasing cutoff does not necessarily improve accuracy.  
- Each force field has been developed using a certain cutoff value, and effects of the truncation were compensated by adjustment of some other parameters.
- To ensure consistency and reproducibility of simulation you should choose the cutoff appropriate for the force field:

| AMBER | CHARM  |  GROMOS  | OPLS |
|:-----:|:------:|:---------:|:----:|
| 8 <span>&#8491;</span> | 12 <span>&#8491;</span> | 14 <span>&#8491;</span> | 11-15 <span>&#8491;</span> (depending on a molecule size)

#### Properties that are very sensitive to the choice of cutoff
- the surface tension [(Ahmed, 2010)]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#Ahmed-2010), 
- the solidâ€“liquid coexistence line [(Grosfils, 2009)]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#Grosfils-2009),
- the lipid bi-layer properties [(Huang, 2014)]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#Huang-2014),
- the structural properties of proteins [(Piana, 2012)]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#Piana-2012).

For such quantities even a cutoff at 2.5 $$ \sigma $$ gives inaccurate results, and in some cases the cutoff must be larger than 6 $$ \sigma $$ was required for reliable simulations [(Grosfils, 2009)]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#Grosfils-2009).

#### Effect of cutoff on energy conservation
- Short cutoff may lead to an increase in the temperature of the system over time. 
- The best practice is to carry out trial simulations without temperature control to test it for energy leaks or sources before a production run.

## Truncation of the Electrostatic Interactions
- Electrostatic interactions occurring over long distances are important for biological molecules. 
- Simple increase of the cutoff distance to account for long-range interactions can dramatically raise simulation time. 
- In periodic simulation systems, the electrostatic interaction is divided into two parts: a short-range contribution, and a long-range contribution. 
- The short-range contribution is calculated by exact summation of all pairwise interactions of atoms separated by a distance that is less than cutoff in real space. 
- The forces beyond the cutoff radius are approximated in Fourier space commonly by the Particle-Mesh Ewald (PME) method.
